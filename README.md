# B-zone
SEP-2023/Q3 Bumbal zone management

In this README file it is detailed which files should not be checked in the code quality assessment. This is separated into backend and frontend parts, since the backend uses Go, which cannot be checked with the suggested tools and thus in discussion with the course coordinator different tools were chosen.
