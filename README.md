### Setting up Frontend
##### Installation
**Node.js** can be installed from the following link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

##### Set up
In the terminal run `cd frontend`, to access the frontend app. To start the web app run `npm start`. The web app should open a tab automatically, but if this is not the case it is located at http://localhost:3000/. To stop the app, press `Ctrl + c` in the terminal and answer `y` to the prompt (if there is one).
